<span style="font-size: 1.5em;padding-top:2em;">Market Report: Big Opportunities in Road Construction Boom</span>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.00em;" class="writeup">
As the Abbott government gears up to fulfil infrastructure promises, builders and contractors face significant opportunities from a sound pipeline of road construction projects, albeit with activity on the construction of other forms of transport set to drop back a bit.<br><br>             

<img src="/img/roadwork.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; padding: 0 0 1em 0;"><br>
Having dropped to post GFC lows of
$15.686 billion in 2013/14, the dollar value
of work done on construction of roads
throughout Australia is set to remain at a
modest $15.713 billion in 2014/15 but rise to
$18.183 billion in 2016/17 before hitting a
record $19.452 billion in 2017/18, according
to the most recent forecast from Australian
Construction Industry Forum.<br><br>

Activity on other non­road forms of
transport, however, are expected to drop
back to a still historically respectable $9.560
billion by 2017/18 after a strong year of
activity in 2014/15 ($13.820 billion).
Opportunities abound in several states, with
a number of projects set to keep activity at
high levels in New South Wales. Big
comebacks are expected in Queensland,
South Australia and Western Australia
following periods of relatively soft
conditions in these states.<br><br>

Behind this activity lies robust levels of
population growth as well as the well
documented federal government push for
infrastructure and especially new roads.
Still, much uncertainty remains. Victoria
has cancelled the East West Link Project
and the government in that state is currently
wrangling with the consortium that had
been slated to carry out that work over
compensation. The Vic government is
promising to build a new rail link, widen the
Tullamarine Freeway, upgrade rural and
regional roads and remove dangerous level
crossings.<br><br>

In Queensland, meanwhile, a plan to
privatise electricity assets in order to pay off
public debt and beef up infrastructure
spending will not go ahead given the change
in government in that state and
commitments on the part of the new Labor
government not to privatise assets. While
Labor’s plans regarding infrastructure are
yet to be announced, it is likely their
program of investment will not be as
extensive as that previously planned by the
LNP as they will not have the benefit of
funds from privatised assets.<br><br>

Moreover, a deteriorating fiscal position
may challenge the federal government’s
capacity to fund its infrastructure hopes,
while the fiscal position of many states will
mean extensive investment in capital assets
will be difficult to achieve in absence of
substantial private investment.<br><br>

All this could put some dints in the above
forecasts, which were issued prior to the
Queensland and Victorian elections.

<span style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight:600;">New South Wales</span><br><br>

Thanks to strong levels of public
infrastructure spending, the value of work
done on road construction in New South
Wales will remain at historically elevated
levels of between $5.7 billion and $6 billion
per annum over the coming years. Activity
on non­road forms of transport will rise
from a low of $2.239 billion in 2013/14 to
$2.623 billion in 2014/15 and remain at
historically respectable levels thereon after.<br><br>

<strong>Significant upcoming projects (as per
Cordell – information updated late 2014):</strong>

    <ul>
        <li>WestConnex – Overall Project, $11.5
        billion, start: Jul 15, tunnels/subways,
        linking of Parramatta to Sydney CBD
        and Sydney Airport, stage: early</li>
        <li>WestConnex M4 East – Parramatta to

<p style="font-size: 1.00em;" class="writeup">
    <span style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight:600;">Victoria</span><br>

    Although the value of work done on nonroad
    forms of transport infrastructure in
    Victoria is expected to drop back from a
    peak of $1.519 billion in 2013/14 to just
    $891 million in 2016/17 as work on the
    Regional rail Link finishes up, that done on
    roads is expected to bottom out at decade
    lows of $1.617 billion in 2014/15 before
    returning to more respectable levels of
    $2.253 billion two years later (note: the
    forecast was made before cancellation of
    East West Link).<br><br>

    <strong>Significant upcoming projects (information
    per Cordell):</strong>

    <ul>
        <li>Melbourne Rail Link, $8.5 billion, start:
        June 17, Link from South Yarra station
        to northern rail lines, status: early

    <span style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight:600;">Queensland</span><br>
    Queensland is expected to experience a
    significant rebound in construction work on
    road and non­road forms of transport
    construction with the former expected to
    bottom out at decade lows of $4.297 billion
    in 2013/14 to reach $6.034 billion in
    2015/16 and the latter expected to bottom
    out at $1.195 billion in 2013/14 to reach
    $1.405 billion in 2015/16. These forecasts
    were issued before the state election and
    considerable levels of uncertainty exist
    regarding the new government’s
    infrastructure intentions.<br><br>
    <strong>Significant upcoming projects:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Toowoomba Second Range Crossing,

    <span style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight:600;">Western Australia</span><br>
    Helped along by work on projects such as
    Gateway WA and the Mitchell Freeway
    extension project, the value of road building
    activity in Western Australia is set to bounce
    back to more than $2.7 billion in by 2016/17
    after bottoming out at just over $1.7 billion
    this year. Activity on ports, railways and
    bridges is set to drop back from an
    exceptional $7.326 billion in 2014/15 to less
    than $4 billion by 2017/18 as work on
    infrastructure associated with resource
    projects dries up.<br><br>
    <strong>Significant upcoming projects:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Anketell Point Port, $3.1 billion, start

    <span style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight:600;">South Australia</span><br>
    Thanks to work on a range of projects
associated with the South Road upgrade, the
value of road building activity is set to
bottom out at $751 million in 2014/15
before more than doubling to $$1.633
billion by 2017/18. Activity on non­road
forms of transport is expected to increase
from $377 million to $498 million.
