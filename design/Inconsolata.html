<blockquote>

<p>Inconsolata is my first serious original font release. It is a
monospace font, designed for code listings and the like, in print.
There are a great many "<a href="http://www.lowing.org/fonts/">programmer fonts</a>," designed
primarily for use on the screen, but in most cases do not have the
attention to detail for high resolution rendering.
</p>

<p>Inconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources. I was
particularly struck by the beauty of Luc(as) de Groot's Consolas,
which is his monospaced design for Microsoft's upcoming Vista
release. This font, similar to his earlier <a href="http://www.fontfabrik.com/fofafon4.html">TheSansMono</a>,
demonstrated clearly to me that monospaced fonts do not have to
suck.</p>

<p>First and foremost, Inconsolata is a humanist sans design. I strove
for the clarity and clean lines of Adrian Frutiger's Avenir (the
lowercase "a", in particular, pays homage to this wonderful design),
but also looked to Morris Fuller Benton's Franklin Gothic family for
guidance on some of my favorite glyphs, such as lowercase "g" and
"S", and, most especially, the numerals.</p>

<p>Designing a monospace font poses unique challenges. I have
carefully studied many other monospaced fonts to see how they solve
these problems. Many of the available monospace fonts are adaptations
of existing proportionally-spaced fonts, but some, such as Letter
Gothic, draw strength from being their own designs. I hope Inconsolata
upholds that tradition.</p>

<p>Some details will be most apparent in print, such as the subtle
curves in lowercase "t", "v", "w", and "y". Inconsolata also borrows
"micro-serifs" from some Japanese Gothic fonts, which enhance the
appearance of crispness and legibility.</p>

<p>I'm still working on completing this font, refining the base ASCII
set and filling out the Latin 1, 2, and 9 complements. It will be
released under the new <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=OFL&_sc=1">Open
Font License</a> of SIL. Completion of this font is being generously

this font and want to see more sponsored and released freely, please
